Question 3

Part A: 

-> NOT a max Heap: Violates order property. Node 25 is bigger than its parent i.e. 10.


Part B:

->NOT a max Heap: Violates shape property. A hole in the array causes the tree to be not complete.

Part C:

->IS a valid max Heap: Every node is greater than or equal to its children. The array does not have holes so the binary tree is complete.
